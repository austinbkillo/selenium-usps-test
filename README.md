Hello!

These are a set of automated tests created through Selenium with JavaScript and Mocha. The tests are designed to test the USPS postal calculator, and fail when the price of ground shipping is over 80 dollars.

To run this code, download the repository and run the usual -

  `npm install`
  - this will get all of the dependencies needed to run the code.

  To run the tests themselves, run
  `npm test`

  Then sit back and watch the magic happen!
  An HTML report with a screenshot of the failed tests will be generated in the `reports` folder, but it should pop up on your screen as well automatically.

  (Note - you may need to enable your browser to allow automation for these tests to work. I had to do this for Safari.)
